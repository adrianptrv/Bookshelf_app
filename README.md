# Bookshelf web application

This is my first project using TypeScript, and also the first time using Tailwind CSS for the styles. 

## Overview

The idea was to create a responsive web application using TypeScript and the OOP paradigm. 
I decided that creating a Bookshelf web app was a great idea to practice both TypeScript and OOP.
As a whole the app is pretty straightforward, the user puts in information about a book that he has, and the book will be added as a new entry (row) into the table (Bookshelf). The books can also be removed from the table.
All of the app styles are coming from Tailwind, I challenged myself to not write any lines of CSS code.

Also I have added two error messages, which are appearing if the user either: 
- Doesn't fill all of the field.
- Fill a field with wrong type of information (e.g Write text in the "Year" field).

I have also made the Bookshelf entries to be stored in the local storage, and respectively when the user loads the page, their previous entries would be loaded in the table.
